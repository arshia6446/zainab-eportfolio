        <!-- MOODBOARD -->
        <h2 class="section-heading">Moodboard & Visual Research</h2>
        <p>
            The creation process began with assembling a detailed moodboard that brought together all the visual 
            references guiding the development of the final artwork. This included contemporary couture inspirations, 
            Vietnamese phoenix and butterfly motifs, bold Marimekko-style patterns, colour psychology charts, and 
            material samples such as organza, satin, and Swarovski embellishments. These references shaped the emotional 
            tone of the project, establishing themes of transformation, rebirth, freedom, and happiness. Anh Thư’s Ice 
            Phoenix gown guided research into gradient storytelling and symbolic styling, while Marimekko’s textiles 
            supported research into repetition, joyful palettes, and visual symbolism.
        </p>


        <!-- ARTISTIC INTENTION -->
        <h2 class="section-heading">Artistic Intention (Aligned With SOI)</h2>
        <p>
            Inquiry: Happiness can be interpreted from and communicated through shared visuals.
        </p>
        <p>
            The artistic intention behind this piece is to create emotional storytelling through symbolic motifs, 
            thoughtful material choices, and colour transitions. Guided by phoenix rebirth symbolism and butterfly 
            transformation, the design highlights how identity and cultural storytelling can visualize inner strength. 
            A flowing silhouette, layered organza, ombré colours, and reflective crystals communicate an emotional 
            journey from fragility to empowerment, supporting the SOI through non-verbal visual communication.
        </p>


        <!-- PRACTICAL EXPLORATION INITIAL -->
        <h2 class="section-heading">Practical Exploration — Initial Phase</h2>
        <p>
            Early development involved multiple sketches exploring silhouette possibilities, motif placements, and 
            symbolic meaning. A-line, mermaid, and ballgown shapes were tested to understand how each expressed movement 
            and transformation. Colour testing began with icy blues and purples to explore gradients symbolizing clarity 
            and emotional growth. Phoenix and butterfly motifs were sketched in various arrangements—such as on the back, 
            hem, or flowing upward—to communicate ascension and joy.
        </p>

        <p>
            <strong>Reflection:</strong>  
            Early exploration showed that transcendence was best represented through layered organza and elongated forms, 
            while rigid silhouettes restricted emotional flow. These sketches laid the foundation for further development.
        </p>


        <!-- PRACTICAL EXPLORATION MIDDLE -->
        <h2 class="section-heading">Practical Exploration — Middle Stage</h2>
        <p>
            During the mid-development stage, sketches became more detailed and intentional. Peer and teacher feedback 
            encouraged refining the balance between dramatic storytelling and structural practicality. Phoenix wings were 
            redrawn for organic flow, digital layering improved gradient previews, and crystal placement was mapped to 
            guide the viewer’s eye. Digital renderings allowed testing lighting, transparency, and movement.
        </p>

        <p>
            <strong>Reflection:</strong>  
            This phase confirmed the importance of deliberate motif placement in building a strong emotional narrative, 
            ensuring the artwork expresses empowerment rather than just decorative beauty.
        </p>


        <!-- FINAL STAGE -->
        <h2 class="section-heading">Practical Investigation — Final Stage</h2>
        <p>
            Two physical mock-ups were created to test structure, material behavior, and visual effect. The first used 
            muslin and organza to test silhouette shaping and movement with crystal weight. The second explored motif 
            placement and colour accuracy, including embroidery trials and dye tests for the blue-to-purple gradient.
        </p>

        <p>
            <strong>Reflection:</strong>  
            These tests showed the importance of choosing the correct organza stiffness, as digital sketches did not 
            accurately show how crystals sparkled or how layered fabrics moved in real lighting.
        </p>


        <!-- EVOLUTION OF COMPOSITION -->
        <h2 class="section-heading">Evolution of Composition & Narrative Flow</h2>
        <p>
            The design evolved from simple motif sketches to a fully integrated visual narrative. Early drawings explored 
            isolated phoenix details, while later stages showed the motifs wrapping around the gown to guide the viewer’s 
            gaze. The gradient also grew more dynamic, shifting from a subtle blend to a strong emotional ombré.
        </p>

        <p>
            <strong>Reflection:</strong>  
            This evolution demonstrates an increased understanding of how couture composition can function as visual 
            storytelling, where every placement and colour shift contributes to the emotional message.
        </p>


        <!-- ARTISTIC CHOICES JUSTIFICATION -->
        <h2 class="section-heading">Artistic Choices Justification (Bii)</h2>
        <p>
            Each artistic decision was made with intention and tied closely to the SOI.  
            <strong>Silhouette:</strong> Layered and flowing to express freedom and elevation.  
            <strong>Materials:</strong> Organza for ethereality, satin for structure, crystals for light symbolism.  
            <strong>Motifs:</strong> Phoenix and butterfly motifs represent rebirth, transformation, and joy.  
            <strong>Colour palette:</strong> A blue-to-purple gradient symbolizing clarity and spiritual strength.  
            <strong>Texture:</strong> Hand embroidery and crystals highlight brilliance and radiance.
        </p>


        <!-- FINAL CONCEPT -->
        <h2 class="section-heading">Final Concept Confirmation</h2>
        <p>
            The final design successfully merges research, experimentation, refinement, and symbolic meaning into a 
            cohesive couture artwork. The developmental process—moodboard, ideation, refinement, and material testing—
            shaped a piece that is visually expressive, culturally informed, and emotionally meaningful.
        </p>

        <p>
            <strong>Final Reflection:</strong>  
            This process shows a clear relationship between research and artistic intention. Through symbolism, material 
            exploration, and iterative refinement, the artwork communicates the core themes of happiness, identity, and 
            transformation.
