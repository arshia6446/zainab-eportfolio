        <p>
            Happiness can be derived from and shared through communal visuals, especially in visual culture
            where symbols, colours, and design choices communicate emotional meaning and collective identity.

            This investigation explores how happiness and emotional identity can be communicated through symbolic
            visuals, artistic design, cultural expression, and non-verbal communication.
        </p>

        <!-- FACTUAL QUESTION 1 -->
        <h2 class="section-heading">Factual Question 1 — What symbolic meaning might be read into happiness?</h2>
        <p>
            Happiness can be symbolized in many ways, through colours, shapes, textures, and cultural motifs. A
            sunrise may represent new beginnings, while fireworks show shared joy. Colours like yellow signal warmth
            and cheerfulness, while green often symbolizes growth and peace. Shapes such as hearts, circles, and
            butterflies communicate joy, love, and transformation. In fashion and visual culture, happiness is
            expressed through materials and design choices. Swarovski crystals can represent brilliance and triumph,
            while flowing fabrics suggest freedom and ease. Phạm Đăng Anh Thư’s Ice Phoenix gown, covered in thousands
            of crystals, symbolizes rebirth and radiant transformation. Different cultures interpret symbols
            differently, which makes happiness a flexible but powerful form of non-verbal communication.
        </p>

        <!-- FACTUAL QUESTION 2 -->
        <h2 class="section-heading">Factual Question 2 — Where in our lives can we use non-verbal communication of emotions?</h2>
        <p>
            Non-verbal communication is present in everyday life. A smile, posture, or gesture can express emotion
            without words. Art also communicates emotion through brushstrokes, movement, or sound. Fashion silently
            conveys identity and confidence, as seen in Anh Thư’s crystal corsets that express elegance and joy.
            Rituals such as weddings, festivals, and blessings use flowers, colours, and gestures to communicate
            collective happiness. Even digital spaces use emojis and visual cues to show humor, affection, or excitement.
