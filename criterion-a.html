        <!-- STATEMENT OF INVESTIGATION -->
        <h2 class="section-heading">Statement of Investigation</h2>
        <p>
            Happiness can be derived from and shared through communal visuals, especially in visual culture
            where symbols, colours, and design choices communicate emotional meaning and collective identity.

        <!-- FACTUAL, CONCEPTUAL, DEBATABLE QUESTIONS OVERVIEW -->
        <h2 class="section-heading">Unit Focus & Guiding Questions</h2>
        <p><strong>Key Concept:</strong> Communication</p>
        <p><strong>Related Concepts:</strong> Visual culture, interpretation</p>
        <p><strong>Global Context:</strong> Identities and relationships</p>

        <h2 class="section-heading">Factual, Conceptual & Debatable Questions</h2>
        <p>
            This investigation explores how happiness and emotional identity can be communicated through symbolic
            visuals, artistic design, cultural expression, and non-verbal communication.
        </p>

        <!-- FACTUAL QUESTION 1 -->
        <h2 class="section-heading">Factual Question 1 — What symbolic meaning might be read into happiness?</h2>
        <p>
            Happiness can be symbolized in many ways, through colours, shapes, textures, and cultural motifs. A
            sunrise may represent new beginnings, while fireworks show shared joy. Colours like yellow signal warmth
            and cheerfulness, while green often symbolizes growth and peace. Shapes such as hearts, circles, and
            butterflies communicate joy, love, and transformation. In fashion and visual culture, happiness is
            expressed through materials and design choices. Swarovski crystals can represent brilliance and triumph,
            while flowing fabrics suggest freedom and ease. Phạm Đăng Anh Thư’s Ice Phoenix gown, covered in thousands
            of crystals, symbolizes rebirth and radiant transformation. Different cultures interpret symbols
            differently, which makes happiness a flexible but powerful form of non-verbal communication.
        </p>

        <!-- FACTUAL QUESTION 2 -->
        <h2 class="section-heading">Factual Question 2 — Where in our lives can we use non-verbal communication of emotions?</h2>
        <p>
            Non-verbal communication is present in everyday life. A smile, posture, or gesture can express emotion
            without words. Art also communicates emotion through brushstrokes, movement, or sound. Fashion silently
            conveys identity and confidence, as seen in Anh Thư’s crystal corsets that express elegance and joy.
            Rituals such as weddings, festivals, and blessings use flowers, colours, and gestures to communicate
            collective happiness. Even digital spaces use emojis and visual cues to show humor, affection, or excitement.
            Non-verbal communication crosses cultures and languages, making emotions instantly recognizable.
        </p>

        <!-- CONCEPTUAL QUESTION 1 -->
        <h2 class="section-heading">Conceptual Question 1 — What is happiness, and how do people in our society define and benefit from it?</h2>
        <p>
            Happiness is often described as well-being, balance, and fulfillment, but it varies from person to person.
            Some find happiness in goals and success; others find it in family, faith, creativity, or community.
            Fashion and art express happiness as empowerment, confidence, or beauty. Wearing a crystal-covered gown,
            like Anh Thư’s Ice Phoenix, can symbolize both inner joy and personal expression. Happiness improves mental
            health, strengthens relationships, increases creativity, and supports resilience. A happy community values
            empathy, culture, and self-expression.
        </p>

        <!-- CONCEPTUAL QUESTION 2 -->
        <h2 class="section-heading">Conceptual Question 2 — How does society respond to emotional well-being, and how can people act upon it?</h2>
        <p>
            Society’s approach to emotional well-being varies. Some cultures openly promote mental health support,
            mindfulness, and creative expression, while others may stigmatize emotional struggles. Visual culture helps
            fill these gaps by allowing people to express feelings through symbols, colours, and design. Anh Thư’s gowns
            empower the wearer and allow emotions like confidence and triumph to be seen. People can support emotional
            well-being by being empathetic, encouraging creative expression, and creating safe spaces for communication.
            Festivals, art events, and rituals help communities celebrate happiness together.
        </p>

        <!-- CONCEPTUAL QUESTION 3 -->
        <h2 class="section-heading">Conceptual Question 3 — How does visual culture express values on social media and face-to-face?</h2>
        <p>
            Visual culture communicates values universally, both online and in person. Social media uses emojis, art,
            photography, and viral images to show happiness or empowerment. A sparkling couture gown might gain
            attention for its emotional impact, not only its design. In person, visual culture appears in murals,
            rituals, fashion shows, and traditional crafts. A Swarovski-embroidered wedding dress expresses unity and
            joy, while murals may symbolize hope or protest. Visual culture allows values to be shared instantly and
            emotionally across communities.
        </p>

        <!-- DEBATABLE QUESTION -->
        <h2 class="section-heading">Debatable Question — How do different people and cultures define happiness?</h2>
        <p>
            Happiness differs widely across cultures. In collectivist cultures, happiness is linked to family, unity,
            and community rituals. In individualist cultures, happiness may be tied to independence, success, or
            personal expression, such as wearing a bold, crystal-covered corset to show confidence. Some view happiness
            as comfort and wealth; others see it as spiritual peace or artistic fulfillment. Asian phoenix symbolism
            represents rebirth and harmony, while Western couture sometimes expresses happiness through spectacle and
            power. Happiness is diverse, shaped by identity, beliefs, and cultural values.

        <!-- ART MOVEMENT SECTION -->
        <h2 class="section-heading">Art Movement — Contemporary Couture</h2>
        <p><strong>Time Period & Origin:</strong> Early 2000s, developed strongly in Paris before spreading globally.</p>
        <p><strong>Influences:</strong> Chanel, Dior, McQueen; Vietnamese phoenix symbolism; Finnish design optimism.</p>
        <p><strong>Major Artists:</strong> Phạm Đăng Anh Thư, Alexander McQueen.</p>
        <p><strong>Characteristics:</strong> Flowing fabrics, sculptural silhouettes, heavy embellishment, hand embroidery,
            organza layering, Swarovski crystals, colour gradients, emotional storytelling.</p>
        <p><strong>Genre:</strong> Wearable art, symbolic couture, fashion-art crossover.</p>

        <!-- CASE STUDY 1 -->
        <h2 class="section-heading">Case Study 1 — Phạm Đăng Anh Thư</h2>
        <p>
            Vietnamese couturier Phạm Đăng Anh Thư blends cultural symbolism with European couture techniques. Her Ice
            Phoenix gown uses satin for structure, organza for flow, and thousands of Swarovski crystals for brilliance
            and empowerment. The blue-to-purple gradient represents clarity and spiritual transformation, while the
            phoenix symbolizes resilience. Her designs emphasize meaning over trends, using line, colour, texture,
            balance, and repetition to evoke feelings of strength and rebirth. This case study informs symbolic motifs,
            gradients, and storytelling techniques used in my own design process.
        </p>

        <!-- CASE STUDY 2 -->
        <h2 class="section-heading">Case Study 2 — Marimekko</h2>
        <p>
            Founded in Finland in 1951, Marimekko transformed textile design through bold patterns and vibrant colours.
            The Unikko (Poppy) print symbolizes joy and collective positivity through simplified floral shapes, rhythm,
            and repetition. Marimekko’s philosophy brings art into daily life, contrasting with exclusive haute couture.
            The designs reflect Finland’s post-war optimism and cultural identity. Studying Marimekko helped shape my use
            of pattern repetition, colour harmony, and emotional storytelling.
        </p>

        <!-- COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS -->
        <h2 class="section-heading">Comparative Analysis</h2>
        <p><strong>Anh Thư:</strong> symbolic motifs, gradients, sculptural forms, empowerment.</p>
        <p><strong>Marimekko:</strong> bold repetition, joyful colours, accessible pattern design.</p>
        <p>
            Together, they show how both individual emotion (empowerment, transformation) and collective joy (optimism,
            unity) can be communicated visually.
        </p>

        <!-- CONCLUSION -->
        <h2 class="section-heading">Conclusion</h2>
        <p>
            Contemporary couture and textile design demonstrate how visual culture communicates different forms of
            happiness. Through symbolic motifs, colour psychology, and emotional storytelling, art becomes a universal
            bridge across identities and cultures.
